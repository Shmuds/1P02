    <p> I just want to start off by saying this class is the most interesting
      class I've ever taken in my <strong> life. </strong> <br /> I am very glad I signed up for it,
      and plan on taking other classes in the future, which will <em> hopefully </em>
      benefit me in my days to come. </p>

<!-- This riddle I got from  http://tolkien.cro.net/talesong/riddles.html-->
<h3> This is a riddle from The Hobbit </h3>

<p> This thing all things devours:
 Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
 Gnaws iron, bites steel;
 Grinds hard stones to meal;
 Slays king, ruins town,
 And beats high mountain down.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> If you want to attempt the <em> riddle </em> that is great,
